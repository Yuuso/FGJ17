We used our own game engine:
https://github.com/Yuuso/SpehsEngine
Extended engine features: https://github.com/Yuuso/Extended-SpehsEngine.git

To build the game, create a new Visual Studio project. SpehsEngine and Extended SpehsEngine must be set up but that is another story that we are not going to delve into.
Source files would then be placed inside the project folder and the game is ready to be built.
